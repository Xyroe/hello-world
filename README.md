# hello-world
Hello world thing as directed by GitHub guide

I have many names, but here you will know me as Xyroe. I mainly code in java and Python, love anything involving science and/or math (especially physics), have interest in learning as much as I can and increasing my skillset in order to do what I can for others, and I hope to someday successfully do some personal work with artificial intelligence. Hope you have a nice day. Peace.
